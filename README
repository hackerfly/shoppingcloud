"ShoppingCloud" Ruby on Rails E-commerce Engine

#Intro

"From the day Richard "rms" Stallman published the GNU Manifesto to
Linus Torvalds producing Linux to DHH's Ruby on Rails, it has been a
very well gracious thanks to all who have supported and contributed to
"free software" movement.

#Why ShoppingCloud?

    production-ready
    bug-tested
    fresh and ready for major developments

#What is the purpose of this?

    Apparently most of free software right now tends to be "one for
    all" and we believe that it causes slow development which defeats
    our initial purpose for free software. We aim to identify the
    specific specifications for production working code for the simple
    reason of improving the development of existing codes. And to spread
    the "good code".

#What do you "specifically" need for this install?

    Ruby 1.8..6
    Ruby on Rails 2.2.2
    Webmin 1..480
    Phusion_Passenger 2.2.2
    Apache Webserver
    PostgreSQL Database Server
